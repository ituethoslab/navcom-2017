    "\n",
    "No, not an IPA even though it is Little-Friday. *Application Programming Interface* (API) is a service allowing software to exchange information with another piece of software. These services are requests ordering this information e.g. a request for a webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you type \"www.twitter.com\" as a URL, your browser sends a request to Twitterâ€™s remote server. Once your browser receives the response, it can interpret the code and display the page. To the browser, Twitterâ€™s server is an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is Twitter bot which posts random emoji star fields [@tiny_star_field](https://twitter.com/tiny_star_field). Somebody made another bot [@tiny_astro_naut](https://twitter.com/tiny_astro_naut) which [replies by adding a space rocket](https://twitter.com/tiny_astro_naut/status/913032959439097856), and yet somebody else made a third bot which adds a mission control room.

    "A more tangible example of an API could be the online travel service Momondo.com. You use an API to request a specific result of possible flights using Momondoâ€™s predetermined variables. In this case, you have the possibility to order Momondo to interact with various airline APIs and display the results to you. \n",

    "<p>You can specify a list of tracking criteria consisting of single or multiple keyword queries, hashtags, and specific phrases. Each query should be separated by a comma. If you want to track a literal phrase, encapsulate it in single quotes (').</p>\n",

    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li><strong>a single word/hashtag</strong>. Consider that Twitter does not do partial matching on words, i.e. <tt>[twitter]</tt> will get tweets with <tt>[twitter]</tt>, <tt>[#twitter]</tt> but not <tt>[twitteraddiction]</tt></li>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<li><strong>two or more words</strong>: works like an AND operator, i.e. <tt>[global warming]</tt> will find tweets that have both <tt>[global]</tt> and <tt>[warming]</tt> in any position in the tweet, e.g. <tt>\"life is global but not warming\"</tt></li>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<li><strong>exact phrases</strong>: <tt>['global warming']</tt> will get only tweets with the exact phrase. Beware, however that due to how the streaming API works, tweets are captured in the same way as in 2, but tweets that do not match the exact phrase are thrown away. This means that you will request many more tweets from the Twitter API than you will see in your query bin - thus increasing the possibility that you will hit a rate limit. E.g. if you specify a query like <tt>['are we']</tt> all tweets matching both <tt>[are]</tt> and <tt>[we]</tt> are retrieved, while DMI-TCAT only retains those with the exact phrase <tt>['are we']</tt></li>\n",
